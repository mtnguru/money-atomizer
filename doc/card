So the game board is like a viewer.
The atom-builder has the main viewer, and it has the pte viewer.
Having two viewers might explain 

This is the game board.  It's like the backdrop of the entire game.  Or is it?  Should it have it's own camera?

Should each canvas have their own camera and scene, yes.
The atom builder assumes a single primary canvas, but I could have multiple ones.  So how do I fix this?

When I create the board, I create the camera.  Somehow the viewer class doesn't need to do anything.  For now.

So the board starts a viewer.  The viewer manages the camera, renderer

Does each viewer have its own controls?:q
